A turn has two main steps:\n\nDraw a Tile\n\nOn your turn, you must draw one tile.\n\nYou can draw from the wall (the normal stack of tiles) OR call a discard if it completes a set for your hand.\n\nDiscard a Tile\n\nAfter drawing, you must discard one tile face-up into the center.\n\nYour hand always returns to 13 tiles (or 14 if you’re declaring Mahjong).\n\n\n\n\nCalling Discards\nWhen someone discards a tile, other players have the chance to call it:\n\nPung/Kong/Quint: If the discard completes your set of 3, 4, or 5 identical tiles, you can call immediately.\n\nMahjong!: If the discard gives you a complete hand from the card, you can declare Mahjong and win the round.\n\nPriority: If multiple players want the same discard, the one declaring Mahjong always takes priority. Otherwise, the player closest in turn order to the discarder gets it.\n\n\nPro tip: You can only call for a pair if it completes a winning Mahjong hand. Otherwise, pairs must be drawn naturally.\n\n\n\nWinning a Hand\nTo declare Mahjong, your hand must:\n\nMatch exactly one of the combinations shown on the card\n\nContain 14 tiles (13 plus the winning tile)\n\nOnce you win, you lay down your tiles for all players to see and the hand ends.\n\n\nEnding Without a Winner\nIf all tiles in the wall are used up before anyone declares Mahjong, the round ends in a wall game. Players reset and start a new hand, rotating the dealer position (East).\nNow that you know how to play, vist our shop"

In Mahjong, the winds follow Asian cardinal points and have traditional associations with seasons (East/Spring, South/Summer, West/Autumn, North/Winter), which may explain why the arrangement differs from a standard compass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wind positions rotate throughout the game, giving each player a turn as the dealer.

    "text": "The American Mahjong card is your guide to winning hands. You can purchase this year’s official card from the National Mah Jongg League. Each line shows exactly what 14 tiles you need to win, using shorthand symbols and helpful notes.\n\n\n\nBasic Structure\nEvery line on the card represents one complete winning hand. The card is organized into different categories, and each hand shows:\n\nShorthand notation (the tile abbreviations)\nNotes (additional details about requirements)\nPoint values (how much the hand is worth)\nConcealed (whether the hand must be concealed, incidated by a C)\n\n\n\n\nShorthand\nThe card uses these standard abbreviations:\n\n1-9: Numbered tiles (any suit: dots, bams, or craks)\nD: Dragon\n0: Soap (white dragon, can be paired with any suit)\nN, E, W, S: Wind tiles (North, East, West, South)\nF: Flower tiles\n\n\n\nExamples\n11 22 333 444 5555\nThis means you need 2 ones, 2 twos, 3 threes, 3 fours, and 4 fives\nFFFF 11 22 333 DDD\nThis means you need 4 flowers, 2 ones, 2 twos, 3 threes, and 3 dragons\n\n\n\nEssential Vocabulary\nUnderstanding these terms is crucial for reading the card:\n\nPair: 2 identical tiles\nPung: 3 identical tiles\n\nKong: 4 identical tiles\nQuint: 5 identical tiles\n\n\n\n\nReading the Notes\nThe notes next to each line give you critical information:\nSuit Requirements\n\n“Same suit” = All numbered tiles must be from the same suit\n“Any 3 suits” = Use tiles from exactly 3 different suits\n“2 suits” = Use tiles from exactly 2 suits\n\nSpecial Conditions\n\n“X” = The pungs (sets of 3), kongs (sets of 4), or quints (sets of 5) can be called from the discards\n“C” = Conceled. NO tiles cannot be called from discards\n“Consecutive numbers” = Numbers must be in order (like 1-2-3)\n\n\n\nExample\nFFFF 11 22 333 DDD (Any 3 Consec. Nos. with Matching Dragons)\nThis means you do not need exactly 11 22 333, but you can use any 3 consecutive numbers (i.e. 44 55 666 or 77 88 999 would also work!). The dragons must match the suit, (i.e. if you numbers are all bams, you must use the green dragons, if your numbers are all craks you must use the red dragon, if your numbers are all dots you must use the white dragon (soap!)).\n\n\n\n\nColor Coding\nWhen numbered tiles appear in the same color on the card, they must all be from the same suit.\nDifferent colors mean you must have different suits for those tiles.\nThis visual system helps you quickly identify suit requirements at a glance.\n\n\nExample\n22 44 44 666 8888 (Any 3 Suits)\nThis means that the suit for the 22 and 44 must match, the suit for the 44 666 must match (and be different from the 22 44 suit), and the 8888 must be in the third suit.\n\n\n\nCommon Card Sections\nThe hands are grouped into sections that appear year after year:\n{Year}: Hands using the current year with numbered tiles and soaps (e.g. 2025)\n2468: Hands with only even numbers\nAny Like Numbers: All numbers are the same (e.g., all 3s)\nMath Sections: Some cards include multiplication/addition themes (e.g., FF 1111 + 6666 = 7777)\nQuints: Hands including 5-of-a-kind groupings\nConsecutive Runs: Numbers in increasing order (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n13579: Hands with only odd numbers\nWinds and Dragons: Hands featuring mostly winds and dragons\n369: Hands using the numbers 3, 6, and 9\nSingles and Pairs: Hands with only single tiles and pairs\n\n\nHow to Use the Card\n\nPick a category that matches tiles you’re collecting\nRead the shorthand to see what tiles you need\nCheck the notes for specific requirements\nCount to 14 to verify it’s a complete hand\n\nThe combination of shorthand + notes tells you exactly what you need to win!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n← Previous\n\n\nNext →\n\n\n\nPro tip: Make sure to read the notes! Sometimes the pattern will use one number, but the notes specify that multiple numbers qualify.\n\nNext Lesson"
