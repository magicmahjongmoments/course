After the tiles are dealt, the game begins with a **Charleston** - a series of tile exchanges between players. Each Charleston consists of three passes, with each player passing exactly 3 tiles during each pass.

The final pass of a Charleston can be a **blind pass**. Instead of selecting 3 tiles from your hand, you can choose 0, 1, or 2 tiles from your own collection and complete the set of 3 by including tiles you just received from another player (without looking at them first).

If all players agree, you can complete **two full Charlestons** before starting the main game. The order of the passes are:

**First Charleston**: Right → Across → Left\
**Second Charleston**: Left → Across → Right

After the Charleston(s), players may make an optional **courtesy pass** with the player sitting across from them. Both players must agree on how many tiles to exchange (0-3 tiles each). Either player can decline to pass any tiles.

**Practice the Charleston:**

Select 3 tiles to pass each time. Drag the tiles to the correct player.

**First Charleston**: Right → Across → Left\
**Second Charleston**: Left → Across → Right

Blind passes can be made on the 2nd Left and 2rd Right.
