Now that you know the tiles, the deal, the Charleston, and the card—it’s time to actually **play the game**!

### The Flow of a Turn

Each player takes turns in **counter-clockwise order**, beginning with East. A turn has two main steps:

1.  **Draw a Tile**
    -   On your turn, you must draw **one tile**.\
    -   You can draw from the **wall** (the normal stack of tiles) OR call a **discard** if it completes a set for your hand.
2.  **Discard a Tile**
    -   After drawing, you must discard **one tile face-up** into the center.\
    -   Your hand always returns to **13 tiles** (or 14 if you’re declaring Mahjong).

### Calling Discards

When someone discards a tile, other players have the chance to **call** it:

-   **Pung/Kong/Quint**: If the discard completes your set of 3, 4, or 5 identical tiles, you can call immediately.\
-   **Mahjong!**: If the discard gives you a complete hand from the card, you can declare **Mahjong** and win the round.\
-   **Priority**: If multiple players want the same discard, the one declaring Mahjong always takes priority. Otherwise, the player closest in turn order to the discarder gets it.

**Pro tip:** You can only call for a pair if it completes a winning Mahjong hand. Otherwise, pairs must be drawn naturally.

### Winning a Hand

To declare Mahjong, your hand must:

-   Match **exactly** one of the combinations shown on the card\
-   Contain **14 tiles** (13 plus the winning tile)

Once you win, you lay down your tiles for all players to see and the hand ends.

### Ending Without a Winner

If all tiles in the wall are used up before anyone declares Mahjong, the round ends in a **wall game**. Players reset and start a new hand, rotating the dealer position (East).
