## The Four Winds Around Your Table

American Mahjong is played by four players, each representing one of the cardinal wind directions.

**East** - The dealer and starting position\
**South** - Sits to East's right\
**West** - Sits across from East\
**North** - Sits to East's left

***Fun Fact:** The wind seating doesn't follow a traditional compass layout. In Mahjong, the winds follow Asian cardinal points and have traditional associations with seasons (East/Spring, South/Summer, West/Autumn, North/Winter), which may explain why the arrangement differs from a standard compass.*

:::

::: {.wall-area .right data-wall="SOUTH"}
:::

::: {.wall-area .top data-wall="WEST"}
:::

::: {.wall-area .bottom data-wall="EAST"}

The wind positions rotate throughout the game, giving each player a turn as the dealer. Don't worry about memorizing everything now, we'll cover the significance of these positions as we progress through the lessons.
